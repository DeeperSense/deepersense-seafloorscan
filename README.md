# DeeperSense UC3: Smart Seafloor Scan

This repository currently implements four modules: **EsViT**, for self-supervised pre-training of side-scan sonar images; **w-s3Tseg**, for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation of the seafloor in side-scan sonar images; and **s3Tseg** and **s3Cseg** for fully-supervised semantic segmentation of the seafloor in side-scan sonar images based on Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks, respectively. The modules are written purely in Python and utilize PyTorch for model training.
