# DeeperSense UC3: Smart Seafloor Scan

This repository currently implements four modules: [EsViT](https://github.com/DeeperSense/deepersense-seafloorscan/tree/main/self_supervised/esvit), for self-supervised pre-training of side-scan sonar images; [w-s3Tseg](https://github.com/DeeperSense/deepersense-seafloorscan/tree/main/weakly_supervised/w-s3Tseg), for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation of the seafloor in side-scan sonar images; and [s3Tseg](https://github.com/DeeperSense/deepersense-seafloorscan/tree/main/fully_supervised/s3Tseg) and [s3Cseg](https://github.com/DeeperSense/deepersense-seafloorscan/tree/main/fully_supervised/s3Cseg) for fully-supervised semantic segmentation of the seafloor in side-scan sonar images based on Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks, respectively. The modules are written purely in Python and utilize PyTorch for model training.
